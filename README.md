# sejal_17_Movie-Recommendation-Analysis
This is my first project based on analysis of movies.
In this project you will get the similar movies by analysing the data of your .CSV file it gives you recommendation.
First you have to download all the neccesary packages etc. which is in the requirements.txt file 
How to run project :
1) in your directory where your project is : open cmd and type the cmd "install -r requirements.txt"
2) if you get an error for version just remove the == part of file for eg: flask==1.1.1 instea of this just eidt "flask " for all the packages
3) After that run the project : main.py file
4) you get the url copy or type the url on browser
THANK YOU!
